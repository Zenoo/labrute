#   downside is that the data is lost when stopping the server. Recommended for development when
#   working on the website interface or translations.
# - "postgres": Store data in a Postgres database. This is the value used in production.

#
# Fields:
# ```
# // Name of the client, as it should be displayed to users
# display_name: OauthClientDisplayName (String)
# // URI of the client homepage, as information for users
# app_uri: Uri (String)
# // Oauth callback URI, where Eternal-Twin will redirect users
# callback_uri: Uri (String)
# // Secret for the client, used when querying the API directly (e.g. to get the OAuth access code)
# secret: Password (String)
